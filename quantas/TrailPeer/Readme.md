# TRAIL

This folder contains code to simulate the TRAIL algorithm for cross-shard transaction validation. The implementation of the algorithm is contained in TrailPeer.cpp and TrailPeer.hpp. The JSON files in this folder are the input files used to produce the graphable output data. The graphs are created from the output data using the Python script "Parser.py". Additional graphs can be obtained by running time_to_failure.py.
